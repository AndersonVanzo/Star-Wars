                    <p class="hs-txt">&emsp;In 1971, George Lucas signed a contract with Universal Studios to direct two films. He intended one of them to be a space opera;
                    however, knowing film studios were skeptical about the genre, Lucas decided to direct his other idea first, American Graffiti,
                    a coming-of-age story set in the 1960s. In 1973, Lucas started work on his second film's script draft of The Journal of the
                    Whills, a space opera telling the tale of the training of apprentice CJ Thorpe as a "Jedi-Bendu" space commando by the legendary
                    Mace Windy. After Universal rejected the film, 20th Century Fox decided to invest in it. On April 17, 1973, Lucas felt
                    frustrated about his story being too difficult to understand, so he began writing a 13-page script with thematic parallels
                    to Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress; this draft was renamed The Star Wars. By 1974, he had expanded the script into
                    a rough draft screenplay, adding elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a protagonist named Annikin Starkiller. Numerous
                    subsequent drafts evolved into the script of the original film.<br></p>
                    <p class="hs-txt">&emsp;Lucas insisted that the movie would be part
                    of a 9-part series and negotiated to retain the sequel rights, to ensure all the movies would be made. Tom Pollock, then
                    Lucas' lawyer writes: "So in the negotiations that were going on, we drew up a contract with Fox’s head of business affairs
                    Bill Immerman, and me. We came to an agreement that George would retain the sequel rights. Not all the chandising rights]
                    that came later, mind you; just the sequel rights. And Fox would get a first opportunity and last refusal right to make the
                    movie." Lucas was offered $50,000 to write, another $50,000 to produce, and $50,000 to direct the film. Later the
                    offer was increased. American Graffiti cast member Harrison Ford had given up on acting and become a carpenter whom Lucas
                    hired for his home renovations, until Lucas decided to cast him as Han Solo within his film.</p>

                    <p class="hs-txt">&emsp;Star Wars was released on May 25, 1977. It was followed by The Empire Strikes Back, released on May 21, 1980; 
                    the opening crawl of the sequel disclosed
                    it numbered as "Episode V". Though the first film in the series was simply titled Star Wars, with its 1981 re-release it
                    had the subtitle Episode IV: A New Hope added to remain consistent with its sequel, and to establish it as the middle chapter
                    of a continuing saga. Return of the Jedi, the final film in the original trilogy, was numbered as "Episode VI", and released
                    on May 25, 1983. The sequels were all self-financed by Lucasfilm, and generally advertised solely under their subtitles.
                    The plot of the original trilogy centers on the Galactic Civil War of the Rebel Alliance trying to free the galaxy from the
                    clutches of the Galactic Empire, as well as on Luke Skywalker's quest to become a Jedi.</p>

                    <p class="hs-txt">&emsp;After losing much of his fortune in a divorce settlement in 1987, George Lucas had no desire to return to Star Wars, and had
                    unofficially canceled the sequel trilogy by the time of Return of the Jedi. At that point, the prequels were only still
                    a series of basic ideas partially pulled from his original drafts of "The Star Wars". Nevertheless, technical advances in
                    the late 1980s and 1990s continued to fascinate Lucas, and he considered that they might make it possible to revisit his
                    20-year-old material. The popularity of the franchise was reinvigorated by the Star Wars expanded universe storylines set
                    after the original trilogy films, such as the Thrawn trilogy of novels written by Timothy Zahn and the Dark Empire comic
                    book series published by Dark Horse Comics. Due to the renewed popularity of Star Wars, Lucas saw that there was still a
                    large audience. His children were older, and with the explosion of CGI technology he was now considering returning to directing.<br></p>
                    <p class="hs-txt">The prequel trilogy consists of Episode I: The Phantom Menace, released on May 19, 1999; Episode II: Attack of the Clones,
                    released on May 16, 2002; and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, released on May 19, 2005. The plot focuses on the fall
                    of the Galactic Republic, as well as the tragedy of Anakin Skywalker's turn to the dark side.</p>

                    <p class="hs-txt">&emsp;Over the years, Lucas often exaggerated the amount of material he wrote for the series; much of the exaggerations stemmed
                    from the post‐1978 period when the series grew into a phenomenon. Michael Kaminski explained that the exaggerations were
                    both a publicity and security measure, further rationalizing that since the series' story radically changed throughout the
                    years, it was always Lucas' intention to change the original story retroactively because audiences would only view the material
                    from his perspective. The exaggerations created rumors of Lucas having plot outlines a sequel trilogy of (Episodes
                    VII, VIII and IX), which would continue the story after 1983's Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Lucasfilm and George Lucas
                    had denied plans for a sequel trilogy for many years, insisting that Star Wars was meant to be a six-part series, and that
                    no further films would be released after the conclusion of the prequel trilogy in 2005. Although Lucas made an exception
                    by releasing the animated Star Wars: The Clone Wars film in 2008, while promoting it, Lucas maintained his status on the
                    sequel trilogy: "I get asked all the time, 'What happens after Return of the Jedi?,' and there really is no answer for that.
                    The movies were the story of Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker, and when Luke saves the galaxy and redeems his father,
                    that's where that story ends."<br></p>

                    <p class="hs-txt">&emsp;In January 2012, Lucas announced that he would step away from blockbuster films and instead produce smaller arthouse films.
                    Asked whether the criticism he received following the prequel trilogy and the alterations to the re-releases of the original
                    trilogy had influenced his decision to retire, Lucas said: "Why would I make any more when everybody yells at you all the
                    time and says what a terrible person you are?" Despite insisting that a sequel trilogy would never happen, Lucas began
                    working on story treatments for three new Star Wars films in 2011. In October 2012, The Walt Disney Company agreed to buy
                    Lucasfilm and announced that Star Wars Episode VII would be released in 2015. Later, it was revealed that the three new upcoming
                    films (Episodes VII–IX) would be based on story treatments that had been written by George Lucas prior to the sale of Lucasfilm.
                    The co-chairman of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy, became president of the company, reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman
                    Alan Horn. In addition, Kennedy would serve as executive producer on new Star Wars feature films, with franchise creator
                    and Lucasfilm founder Lucas serving as creative consultant.<br></p>
                    <p class="hs-txt">&emsp;The sequel trilogy began with Episode VII: The Force Awakens, released on December 18, 2015. It was followed by Episode VIII:

                    <p class="hs-txt">&emsp;Before selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, and parallel to his development of a sequel trilogy, George Lucas and his original
                    trilogy co-scriptwriter Lawrence Kasdan started development on a film about a young Han Solo. On February 5, 2013, Disney
                    CEO Bob Iger made public the development of the Lawrence Kasdan standalone film, along with an undisclosed film written by
                    Simon Kinberg. On February 6, Entertainment Weekly reported Kasdan's film would focus on Han Solo, while the other on
                    Boba Fett (the info on the later film was never confirmed). Disney CFO Jay Rasulo has described the standalone films
                    as origin stories. Kathleen Kennedy explained that the standalone films will not cross over with the films of the sequel
                    trilogy, stating,<br></p>
                    <p class="hs-txt">&emsp;In April 2015, Lucasfilm and Kennedy announced that the standalone films would be referred to as the Star Wars Anthology
                    films (albeit the word anthology has never been used on any of the films titles, instead choosing to carry the "A Star Wars
                    Story" subtitle below the film's main title.) Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was released on December 16, 2016
                    as the first in an anthology series of films separate from the main episodic saga. The second film Solo: A Star Wars Story,
                    was released on May 25, 2018. The still yet to be titled third film will be based on Boba Fett and will be released in 2020.<br></p>
