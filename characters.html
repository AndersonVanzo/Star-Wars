                    <a>Luke Skywalker</a>
                    <p>Luke Skywalker was a Force-sensitive Human male who helped defeat the Galactic Empire in the Galactic Civil War and helped found the New Republic, as well as the New Jedi Order.
                    Born in 19 BBY as the son of the fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and the Queen and Senator of Naboo, Padmé Amidala, Luke was raised on Tatooine and hidden from Emperor Palpatine and his father, who had recently become Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith. In 0 BBY, Skywalker's life changed forever. A chance purchase of two droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO, led to him to receive training in the ways of the Force from Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and to meet Han Solo, and Princess Leia Organa, who was, unbeknownst to him, his twin sister. Skywalker then destroyed the first Death Star and joined the Rebel Alliance.</p>

                    <a>Anakin Skywalker (Darth Vader)</a>
                    <p>Anakin Skywalker, a Force-sensitive human male, was a Jedi Knight of the Galactic Republic, a hero of the Clone Wars and the Chosen One of the Jedi Order. During the reign of the Galactic Empire, he was known as Darth Vader, Sith Lord and apprentice to Emperor Darth Sidious. Skywalker was born in 41 BBY, forty-one years before the Battle of Yavin, on the planet Tatooine in the Outer Rim Territories of the galaxy. Although he had a mother, Shmi Skywalker, there was no father involved in Skywalker's conception. This revelation led Qui-Gon Jinn—the Jedi Master who discovered Skywalker and liberated him from slavery—to suspect that Skywalker had been conceived by the midi-chlorians. The Jedi High Council initially rejected Jinn's request to train Skywalker, deeming him too emotional and too old to become a Jedi, but later reversed their decision following the Battle of Naboo where they discovered that the Sith had returned.</p>

                    <p>Leia Organa (born Leia Amidala Skywalker) was a Force-sensitive human female who served as princess of Alderaan, a member of the Imperial Senate, a general in the Alliance to Restore the Republic, then a senator in the New Republic, and the founding general of the Resistance. Through it all, she became instrumental in the defeat of the Galactic Empire in the Galactic Civil War and led the fight against the First Order. She was born nineteen years before the Battle of Yavin as the daughter of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala. After her mother died and her father fell to the dark side of the Force to become Darth Vader, Leia was adopted by the House of Organa. She took the place of her adoptive father, Bail Organa, in the Senate and helped lead the fight against the Empire.</p>

He hailed from Corellia and became a smuggler in the employ of Jabba the Hutt, even completing the Kessel Run in less than thirteen parsecs with his prized ship, the Millennium Falcon. He was the son-in-law of fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, husband of Princess Leia Organa, brother-in-law of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker, father of Ben Solo, rivals and close friends with fellow smuggler Lando Calrissian, and best friends with the Wookiee Chewbacca, his trusted co-pilot who swore a life debt to the Corellian smuggler.</p>
